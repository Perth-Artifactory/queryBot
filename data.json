    "first visit": "This is the content of our webpage that includes information for people who are visiting the artifactory for the first time. It can be found at https://artifactory.org.au/pages/first_visit\nYour first visit\nWhen to come\nThe best time to check out the space is at our monthly Open Day which is held on the first Saturday of every month. Drop in any time between 11am and 2pm and we'll have volunteers on hand to talk you through our facilities, events, and community. If you're planning on coming down to an Open Day there's no need to let us know beforehand.\n\nThe next best time is during one of these events:\n\nGeneral Hacking days, our weekly general build days (11am to 5pm every Saturday)\nArduino U, our fortnightly electronics night (7:30pm-10:30pm on Wednesday)\nMetal Monday, our fortnightly metal fabrication night (7pm-10pm on Monday).\nIf your first visit will be during one of these events and you have a focused area of interest not covered by the event in question please get in contact beforehand so we can make sure there's a volunteer around that can answer your specific questions.\n\nYou're also welcome at every other event on our calendar but due to the specialised nature of other events there may not be volunteers around that can answer questions about The Artifactory itself.\n\nWhat to bring\nYou don't need to bring anything if you just want to check out the workshop. If you want to bring a project to work on that's okay too. Please get in contact if you're not sure whether we have the tools required for your project in particular or you need to arrange training/induction on a particular tool.\n\nCost\nThere's no cost to come by for a tour during any of our events. If you want to stick around afterwards and make use of the facilities or participate in an event then you'll need to pay the Day Pass rate ($15).",
    "membership": "This is the contents of the webpage on artifactory memberships.

We do not receive ongoing government funding and pay rent at commercial rates.\n\nIn the interest of supporting the local community we also have several free membership programs for students.\n\nJoining the Artifactory as a member (as opposed to using the space with a Day Pass) requires an application to join.

    "workshop usage": "People can use the artifactory as a casual user (without a membership) but only during an event. This is because the space is only open to the public during events. People can sign up as a member to get 24/7 access to the workshop. The laser cutters, 3d printers, cnc router, lathe, and mill can only be used after going through an induction but other tools typically only require a quick workshop induction. Inductions should be organised beforehand but tools do not need to be booked before they can be used. The best times to use The Artifactory as a casual user is during General Hacking Days, Arduino U, and Metal Monday. The best time to get a tour (but not use tools) is the open day.",
    "bot primer": "When responding to queries we typically refer to ourselves as The Artifactory. Assume that you don't need to include a sign off in responses, that will be handled by an email client."
